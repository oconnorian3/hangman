# Testing #

   * This site works in thebrowsers, Chrome & Firefox. It does not run in Safari which looks to be a common issue with Heroku and Safari (sample thread ,many more) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69526899/heroku-application-not-accessible-on-safari
   * I confirmed that the game gives clear instructions and the flow of the game meakes sense
   * I confirmed that the functions all work as designed and corretly give the expected responses to the user.

**Bugs** 

*Solved Problems*

  * Heroku deploys started to fail . This was due to me adding a dependency to the requirements.txt file using an incorrect syntax. Heroku did not recognise the dependency and failed to deploy as a result. Reading the Heroku build logs gave an error which prompted me to double checy the syntax.

**Validator Testing**

* Ran code through https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ and its showing no errors
    
* Accessibility
  * The colours and fonts are easy to read by passing it through the lighthouse in dev tools.
