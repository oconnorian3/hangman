   * The site is responsive and reacts well to different screen sizes.
   * I confirmed that the navigational links work, are easy to understand and all content text is readable.
   * I confirmed the form does work, each box must be filled otherwise the form will not submit. Also the email field must show a valid email or the form will not send.

**Bugs** 

*Solved Problems*

   * The background in the about us section caused the about us header to become unreadable. Creating a darker backgrouynd solved this
   * On a smaller screen a bit white space formed between the about us section and the main video banner. This was becasue I had a height define for the video and removing this fixed it. 
   * The text in the about us section lost its bullet points on smaller screens. Converting a pixel margin setting to em solved this.
